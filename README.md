**EMG Muscle Movement Detection System**

**Introduction**

This project aims to create a system capable of detecting skeletal muscle movements using Electromyography (EMG) sensors and surface electrodes. The system processes the EMG data using an Arduino Uno R3 board, integrating embedded systems and IoT interfacing techniques to achieve real-time muscle movement detection and visualization.

**Features**
•	EMG Sensor Integration: The system incorporates EMG sensors and surface electrodes to capture electrical signals generated by skeletal muscle contractions. These sensors are placed on specific muscles of interest for detection.
•	Arduino Uno R3 Processing: The Arduino Uno R3 board processes the raw EMG data obtained from the sensors. The board's microcontroller processes and analyses the signals to determine muscle activity.
•	LED Array Output: The system controls an LED array to represent the detected muscle movements visually. The LEDs light up in patterns corresponding to the intensity and duration of muscle contractions.
•	Graph Visualization: The system offers real-time visualization of muscle movement data through the serial monitor of the Arduino IDE. The serial monitor displays graphical representations of muscle activity, allowing users to monitor and analyze the data.
